# üß† EEG Tutorial
## üì• EEG Dataset Downloader

This project provides a unified interface for downloading and preprocessing multiple EEG datasets for motor imagery (MI) research. It uses the [MOABB](https://github.com/NeuroTechX/moabb) (Mother of All BCI Benchmarks) library to access various datasets and processes them into a consistent format for further analysis.

### üìä Supported Datasets

The following datasets are currently supported:

1. **BNCI2014_001**: A 4-class motor imagery dataset with 9 subjects.
- 4 classes: left hand, right hand, feet, tongue
- Trial duration: 4 seconds (2-6s)
- Rest period: 2-3 seconds

2. **BNCI2014_002**: A 2-class motor imagery dataset with 14 subjects.
- 2 classes: right hand, feet
- Trial duration: 5 seconds (3-8s)
- Rest period: 2-3 seconds
- 15 electrodes (3 Laplacian derivations at C3, Cz, C4)

3. **Lee2019_MI**: A 2-class motor imagery dataset with 54 subjects.
- 2 classes: left hand, right hand
- Trial duration: 4 seconds (3-7s)
- Rest period: 6 seconds (¬±1.5s)
- 62 Ag/AgCl electrodes

4. **PhysionetMI**: A 5-class motor imagery dataset with 109 subjects.
- 5 classes: rest, left hand, right hand, hands, feet
- Trial duration: Varies by run type
- Rest period: 3-4 seconds
- Includes both imagined and executed movements

5. **Schirrmeister2017**: A 4-class motor imagery dataset with 14 subjects.
- 4 classes: right hand, left hand, rest, feet
- Trial duration: 4 seconds (0-4s)
- Rest period: 3-4 seconds
- 128 electrodes (44 covering motor cortex)

### ‚ú® Features

**Unified Data Format**: All datasets are processed and saved in a consistent CSV format.

Each dataset is saved as CSV files with the following structure:
- **Columns**: EEG channels, time points, condition, label
- **Attributes**: Sampling rate, electrodes, reference, trial duration, rest period, etc.

**Standardized Preprocessing**: Applies the same preprocessing steps (bandpass filtering, epoch creation) to all datasets.

All datasets are processed with:
- Bandpass filtering (8-30Hz)
- Epoch creation based on task-specific time windows
- Consistent event encoding

**Comprehensive Metadata**: Includes dataset-specific information as attributes in the saved files.

Each dataset includes specific metadata such as:
- Sampling rate
- Electrode configuration
- Reference and ground locations
- Trial duration and rest periods
- Task-specific information

**Error Handling**: Implements robust error handling and retry mechanisms for reliable data processing.

The code includes:
- Automatic retry for failed downloads
- Graceful error handling for missing data
- Detailed logging of processing steps

**Modular Design**: Each dataset has its own processing function, making it easy to add new datasets.

The codebase is structured with:
- Separate processing functions for each dataset
- Consistent interface across all datasets
- Easy extensibility for adding new datasets
