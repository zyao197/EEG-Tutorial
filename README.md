# üß† EEG Tutorial
## üì• EEG Dataset Downloader

This project provides a unified interface for downloading and preprocessing multiple EEG datasets for motor imagery (MI) research. It uses the MOABB (Mother of All BCI Benchmarks) library to access various datasets and processes them into a consistent format for further analysis.

- Rest period: 2-3 seconds
</details>

<details>
<summary>2. **BNCI2014_002**: A 2-class motor imagery dataset with 14 subjects.</summary>

### ‚ú® Features

<details>
<summary>**Unified Data Format**: All datasets are processed and saved in a consistent CSV format.</summary>

Each dataset is saved as CSV files with the following structure:
- **Columns**: EEG channels, time points, condition, label
- **Attributes**: Sampling rate, electrodes, reference, trial duration, rest period, etc.
</details>

<details>
<summary>**Standardized Preprocessing**: Applies the same preprocessing steps (bandpass filtering, epoch creation) to all datasets.</summary>

All datasets are processed with:
- Bandpass filtering (8-30Hz)
- Epoch creation based on task-specific time windows
- Consistent event encoding
</details>

<details>
<summary>**Comprehensive Metadata**: Includes dataset-specific information as attributes in the saved files.</summary>

Each dataset includes specific metadata such as:
- Sampling rate
- Electrode configuration
- Reference and ground locations
- Trial duration and rest periods
- Task-specific information
</details>

<details>
<summary>**Error Handling**: Implements robust error handling and retry mechanisms for reliable data processing.</summary>

The code includes:
- Automatic retry for failed downloads
- Graceful error handling for missing data
- Detailed logging of processing steps
</details>

<details>
<summary>**Modular Design**: Each dataset has its own processing function, making it easy to add new datasets.</summary>

The codebase is structured with:
- Separate processing functions for each dataset
- Consistent interface across all datasets
- Easy extensibility for adding new datasets
</details>
